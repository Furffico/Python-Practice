<P>IT is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. </P>
<P>凡是有钱的单身汉，总想娶位太太，这已经成了一条举世公认的真理。</P>
<P>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. </P>
<P>这样的单身汉，每逢新搬到一个地方，四邻八舍虽然完全不了解他的性情如何，见解如何，可是，既然这样的一条真理早已在人们心目中根深蒂固，因此人们总是把他看作自己某一个女儿理所应得的一笔财产。</P>

<P>"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?" </P>
<P>有一天班纳特太太对她的丈夫说：“我的好老爷，尼日斐花园终于租出去了，你听说过没有？”</P>
<P>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. </P>
<P>班纳特先生回答道，他没有听说过。</P>
<P>"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it." </P>
<P>“的确租出去了，”她说，“朗格太太刚刚上这儿来过，她把这件事的底细，一五一十地告诉了我。”</P>
<P>Mr. Bennet made no answer. </P>
<P>班纳特先生没有理睬她。</P>
<P>"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently. </P>
<P>“你难道不想知道是谁租去的吗？”太太不耐烦地嚷起来了。</P>
<P>"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it." </P>
<P>“既是你要说给我听，我听听也无妨。”</P>
<P>This was invitation enough. </P>
<P>这句话足够鼓励她讲下去了。</P>
<P>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week." </P>
<P>“哦！亲爱的，你得知道，郎格太太说，租尼日斐花园的是个阔少爷，他是英格兰北部的人；听说他星期一那天，乘着一辆驷马大轿车来看房子，看得非常中意，当场就和莫理斯先生谈妥了；他要在‘米迦勒节’以前搬进来，打算下个周未先叫几个佣人来住。”</P>

<P>"What is his name?" </P>
<P>“这个人叫什么名字？”</P>
<P>"Bingley." </P>
<P>“彬格莱。”</P>
